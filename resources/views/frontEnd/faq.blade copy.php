                  <p class="black-font">For more than two hundred years investors have publicly traded stocks and bonds.
                    But those types of investments have their limitations, leading investors to alternative securities
                    for the purpose of generating income, diversifying portfolios, boosting returns, or raising funds
                    for other projects.</p>
                  <p class="black-font">These alternatives include real estate, stock or membership units in
                    privately-held businesses, private equity, commodities, venture capital, farmland/timberland,
                    mineral rights, tax lien certificates, hedge funds, annuities, art and collectibles, or even wine

                  <p class="black-font">Why do people invest in alternative securities? Some of the most prevalent

                    commitment. You must understand and assess the risks involved with your investment. There is no
                    guarantee any companies in which you invest will make a profit. You might lose your entire
                    investment if a company files for bankruptcy.</p>

                  <p class="black-font"></p>Speculative. Investments in startups and early-stage ventures are
                  speculative and these enterprises often fail. Unlike an investment in a mature business where there is
                  a track record of revenue and income, the success of a startup or early-stage venture often relies on
                  the development of a new product or service that may or may not find a market. You should be able to
                  afford and be prepared to lose your entire investment.<p class="black-font">Illiquidity. You will be
                    limited in your ability to resell your investment for the first year and may need to hold your
                    investment for an indefinite period of time. Unlike investing in companies listed on a stock
                    exchange where you can quickly and easily trade securities on a market, you may have to locate an
                    interested buyer when you do seek to resell your crowdfunded investment.</p>
                  <p class="black-font">Cancellation restrictions. Once you make an investment commitment for a
                    crowdfunding offering, you will be committed to make that investment (unless you cancel your
                    commitment within a specified period of time). As detailed in the box below for Changing your mind,
                    the ability to cancel your commitment is limited.</p>
                  <p class="black-font">Valuation and capitalization. Your crowdfunding investment may purchase an
                    equity stake in a startup. Unlike listed companies that are valued publicly through market-driven
                    stock prices, the valuation of private companies, especially startups, is difficult and you may risk
                    overpaying for the equity stake you receive. In addition, there may be additional classes of equity
                    with rights that are superior to the class of equity being sold through crowdfunding.</p>
                  <p class="black-font">Limited disclosure. The company must disclose information about the company, its
                    business plan, the offering, and its anticipated use of proceeds, among other things. An early-stage
                    company may be able to provide only limited information about its business plan and operations
                    because it does not have fully developed operations or a long history to provide</p>
